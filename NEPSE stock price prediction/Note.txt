The project was done as part of my interest in NEPSE. The models were able to predict good enough for 7, 12, and 20 days
respectively. The models had developed an intial bias that caused prices to spike up during first prediction that was avoided 
using 10% cap in NEPSE market. The models are hybrid use concept of CNN for feature extraction, LSTM for dependency relationship 
and Time distribudted layer for time related dependency development.
