# MARKET DATA VISUALIZATION AND ANALSIS<br>
This project is based on Market sales data obtaied from Kaggle.
The main task done in this project are Visualization and analysis of the data and clustering.
The project uses K-Means clustering by use of Elbow method for choosing optimal custer units.
When we have data with large dimensions we need to use dimensionality reduction techniques for reduction. 
Dimensionality reduction aids in classification process by provideing concrete features based on original data with lesser features.
The two dimensionality reduction techniques used are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and AutoEncoders.
The use of Autoencoders gives the better result than PCA.
